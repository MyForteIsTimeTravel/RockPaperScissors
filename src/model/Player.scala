 * 
 *  Notes:
 *
 *      This trait holds all the base functionality for a "player" and is
 *      extended by specific implementations (i.e. DumbPlayer, HumanPlayer)
 *      that enherit this functionality and add their own "makeMove" function
 *      
 *      The trait extends runnable and provides a "run" method for all players.
 *      Also encapsulated within this trait is functionality for packaging messages, 
 *      calculating the number of games played, preparing an "outcome" statement
 *      and retreiving the results of messages when passed a reference to them
 *
